I attended the CoinGeek London conference this past week on a media pass very kindly provided by the CoinGeek team, and I want to share some thoughts on it for people who didn't attend.

First, here's a disclaimer, which shouldn't be necessary but unfortunately is. Readers of this site or my followers on Twitter will know I've tried to be just about as fork-neutral as possible, often with the effect of people in Bitcoin Cash calling me a paid Bitcoin SV operator (and doing a whole lot worse to me) and people in Bitcoin SV, often people who never held BCH before the split, demanding why I'm so stupid that I continue being involved with Bitcoin Cash. I don't *need* a particular fork to win. I have no self-esteem tied up in whether SV or Cash 'wins,' or even BTC, and financially I will be more than fine regardless. I have friends on both sides and see no reason to make enemies over a digital coin.

My opinion is this: I just want big-block Bitcoin—one global chain—as it was originally intended to be by Satoshi Nakamoto and I'll support any project that I think has a chance of becoming that. That means I don't make decisionos about Bitcoin forks based on what is happening in the immediate moment, but what I think might happen in the future.

All that said, here are my impressions after attending the event.

**Way bigger than Reddit and Twitter.** If you were to judge Bitcoin SV by the online activity in the traditional crypto communication channels of choice—Reddit, Twitter and Telegram—you might conclude it is quite small. Yet there were nearly 1,000 people at the event, most of whom I didn't recognize. In fact there were more people at this event than there were at the pre-fork events I attended.

**It's time to stop laughing.** It amazes me to still see friends of mine in Bitcoin Cash laugh BSV off as a fly-by-night scam project that is going to die any day now. 1) That sounds so much like the core trolls of yesterday, and 2) look around. While everyone was mocking Bitcoin SV and dumping their coins at low prices over the last year, a ton of infastructure was being built at an incredibly fast pace and new people were joining SV every day as builders and investors. This became especially clear when Shadders brought the whole full-time Bitcoin SV node team on stage to thank them for their work. There were 18 of them by my count. That doesn't look like a fly-by night project to me. It looks like a serious, professional industry that is investing for the long-term.

**Less talk of law than I thought.** I've been pretty vocal about the fact that one of the things I find annoying about BSV is all the online talk about throwing X or Y person in prison, especially when they're referring to people I consider friends and who I know to be incredible people. I also tend to think there is a bit of a naive faith in the legal system in BSV and perhaps an overcorrection against what I think is a very legitimate critiscm that Bitcoin has for too long suffered from people marketing it as criminal money. So I was surprised to find that among the many people I asked, they all tended to agree with me, and indeed many described themselves as libertarians or anarcho-capitalists. This was such a frequent occurence it's making me wonder whether or not a lot of the online stuff is just trolling. Still, there are some real lawsuits going on and those should stop in my opinion.

**Merchant adoption is seen as less important.** There was almost no talk of merchant adoption at the event and if you'd asked me three or four years ago, I would have said that's a bad sign, but more and more I think merchant adoption is not scalable strategy for global adoption. Rather, the talks focused on enterprise use cases and allowing people to earn money in BSV by selling their data, computing power, applications, or content for micropayments. This seems to make way more sense to me than the grassroots approach. One or two enterprise companies doing millions of transactions per day would pay for network security, and people are more likely to want to use their Bitcoin if they earn it than if they have to go through the clunky process of buying it on an exchange and paying the fees which negate the entire value propisition of Bitcoin.
