*Breaking Satoshi* is a Bitcoin analysis site. We plan to produce several collections, or 'seasons,' of essays once a quarter about the most important questions in Bitcoin, written by Deryk Makgill and occasional guests. Season 1 is under development and will be announced soon.

The lengthier essays will be accompanied by a more regular blog and newsletter.
