Since Breaking Satoshi Season One is a series about Bitcoin's history, let us do a bit of revisionist history to help us understand what Bitcoin would have looked like in its earliest days before Bitcoin even had a price if Satoshi did not intend for Bitcoin to scale in such a way that daily digital cash payments, micropayments, and other low transaction fee use cases were preserved.

Suppose he instead cared about keeping bandwidth prices low at all costs so that everyone could run the Bitcoin software and 'secure the network,' even if that meant throwing out the payments use-case entirely.

It's Halloween night, 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto writes an email to the Cryptography Mailing List announcing a brand new...what? Not 'a new electronic cash system,' as he did in the actual email, because the word cash would suggest immediately to normal people the idea of 'medium of exchange,' and tell them that the value proposition offered by Bitcoin is its superiority in commerce. Instead, the email says something like this.

> I've been working on a new electronic store of value system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.

This is likely not accurate, because 'peer-to-peer' too implies some kind of exchange of value, and for something to be a 'store of value' it must actually have a value, but you get the picture hopefully. Maybe he calls it an 'electronic gold system' or 'bit gold' instead.'

He links to the Bitcoin whitepaper, but it no longer has any of that writing about commerce on the internet being too costly, and the possibility for small, casual transactions limited and and trust-intensive because of the reliance on third parties. He doesn't mention merchants or customers or solving the problem of fraud and chargebacks, as might be expected if one were creating a tool for internet commerce.

Instead, the paper details a scarce, secure digital token that is slow and expensive to transact with and explains that if they can all get enough people buy it, its price might go up. It says that Bitcoin is digital gold, in every meaning of the word. Not only is it scarce like gold and fungible like gold, it's also designed to become even heavier and more expensive over time, and is near useless for online commerce like gold. Every user everywhere must go through the complicated steps of setting up a Bitcoin node because Bitcoin is secured by everyone.

Would anyone want this? Would anyone trust someone who told them to use a new thing they can't see or touch and which has no market value whatsoever, or immediate utility, and which will become very costly for them to send and receive, which requires them to set up special software and hardware, just because someone told them it could possibly be valuable in the future?

'Snake oil' would not even begin to describe a Bitcoin like this. It is likely Bitcoin would have been dead on arrival and Satoshi laughed out of the mailing list for proposing what was obviously some sort of parody or scam.

None of the early bootstrapping, the playful spirit of sending transactions to friends, of buying pizza with 10,000 Bitcoins, would have taken place and Bitcoin, if it did anything at all, would have never grown beyond being a hobby project in a chatroom for internet anarchists.

Yet this is what the dominant developers and intellectuals in Bitcoin say Satoshi Nakamoto intentionally tried to create, and the one they helped fully realize when they broke Bitcoin by intentionally limiting its capacity to process transactions at low fees.

Today, Bitcoin is often slow, often expensive to transact, and nearly unusable in regular commerce. New businesses no longer join the Bitcoin ecosystem as merchants because Bitcoin does not offer them any improvement over credit cards and PayPal. The only think Bitcoin has going for it is its inexplicably high price, its ability to 'store value' and even that has been dropping for two years at the time of this writing.

I'll get into some theories about why the price remains what is is later in the series and some useful metaphors for understanding it, but the short answer now is that Bitcoin's ability to store value is ironically and tragically bound up in the public not realizing how much Bitcoin has changed from Satoshi's original vision, and we know this because this simple exercise in revisionism shows us how ridiculous it would have been to market and launch a technology that works like Bitcoin works today.
