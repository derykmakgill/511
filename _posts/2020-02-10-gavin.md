title: Gavin Andresen quotes on big-block Bitcoin
author: Deryk Makgill
permalink: /gavin/
---

I'm 'open-sourcing' some research I've been doing on the early scaling debates. 

I've spent a lot of time reading old Gavin Andresen posts, mostly on [Bitcoin Talk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=224) but also on some other sites, and I find it fascinating to see how intelligent, well-argued and predictive Gavin was about the need to raise the Bitcoin block size and the fallacies used by the then small minority who thought blocks should be locked at 1mb forever.

There was a time before the censorship, lies, blacklisting and propaganda where big-block Bitcoin was the consensus position by nearly everyone who had been involved with Bitcoin since the early days, and the quotes from Gavin I've gathered here are a reminder of that.

**If you like this and want to support the many hours that went into gathering all this, send me a tip!**

## Not Satoshi's vision

>The problem people are worried about if the maximum block size is too high: That big miners with high-bandwidth, high-CPU machines will drive out either small miners or I-want-to-run-a-full-node-at-home people by producing blocks too large for them to download or verify quickly
>
>An adaptive limit could be set so that some minority of miners can 'veto' block size increases; that'd be fine with me.
>
>But it wouldn't help with "I want to be able to run a full node from my home computer / network connection." Does anybody actually care about that? Satoshi didn't, his vision was home users running SPV nodes and full nodes being hosted in datacenters.

## Artificial block size caps are production quotas

>Why do you want miners to have an incentive to make smaller blocks?
>
>Smaller blocks means fewer transactions, so fewer opportunities to collect fees, so less profit.
>
>Miner profit in fiat currency = number of transactions * average transaction fee * btc-to-fiat exchange rate
>
>Experience (and common sense) says that more usage of Bitcoin means a higher btc-to-fiat exchange rate, so if you want to maximize miner's fee revenue then increasing the number of transactions is the obvious way to do it.
>
>If you think that putting an artificial cap on the number of transactions will increase overall miner profit, then I urge
you to find a Real Economist and talk to them about the wisdom of trying to use production quotas to keep prices
artificially high.

## There is no tragedy of the commons

>There is no tragedy-of-the-commons race to zero transaction fees, because miners do not have infinite bandwidth, memory or CPU to accept and validate transactions.
>
>Assuming network bandwidth is the eventual bottleneck, and assuming there is demand for transactions to fill the available network-wide bandwidth (even if that demand is transaction spammers), nodes will start dropping transactions before they
relay them. Prioritizing them based on fee paid and dropping the lowest fee/kb transactions will result naturally in a
working market for fee-paying transactions.

## Get big fast by growing the chain

>I see one big problem that needs solving:
>
>Supporting lots (millions, eventually billions) of people transacting in Bitcoin.
>Ideally at as low a cost as possible, as secure as possible, and in the most decentralized and censorship-resistant way possible.
>
>It is hard to get consensus on HOW to solve that problem, because no solution is obviously lowest cost, most secure, and most decentralized all at the same time, and different people assign different weights to the importance of those three things.
>
>My bias is to "get big fast" -- I think the only way Bitcoin thrives is for lots of people to use it and to be happy using it. If it is a tiny little niche thing then it is much easier for politicians or banks to smother it, paint it as "criminal money", etc. They probably can't kill it, but they sure could make life miserable enough to slow down adoption by a decade or three.
>
>"Get big fast" has been the strategy for a few years now, ever since the project became too famous to fly under the radar of regulators or the mainstream press.
>
>The simplest path to "get big fast" is allowing the chain to grow. All the other solutions take longer or compromise decentralization (e.g. off-chain transactions require one or more semi-trusted entities to validate those off-chain transactions). I'm listening very carefully to anybody who argues that a bigger chain will compromise security, and those concerns are why I am NOT proposing an infinite maximum block size.

## Many small transactions are more secure

>**Quote from: davout on February 01, 2015, 09:05:16 PM
>What's the problem with paying 10 bucks instead of 10 cents to securely transfer a million dollars?**
>
>What's wrong?
>
>Lets say those million dollar transactions are 250 bytes.  That is 4,000 of them in a 1MB block.
>
>So $40,000 total reward to the miner -- about eight times current block reward.
>
>BUT YOU ARE SECURING TRANSACTIONS WORTH SOMETHING LIKE 2,000 TIMES MORE VALUABLE THAN TODAY'S TRANSACTIONS (estimated average transaction USD value for today's average transaction is about $380). And I GUARANTEE that attackers would have a much easier time pulling off a double-spend of one million-dollar transaction than 1,000 $1,000 transactions.
>
>The math for "large value transactions will generate enough fees to secure the chain" just doesn't work.
>The math for "lots of small transactions will generate enough fees to secure the chain" might.

## Blocksize Economics

>With absolutely no artificial limits to supply (like a maximum block size), transaction fees would drop to the marginal cost miners pay for hardware, electricity and bandwidth, plus enough net income to motivate them to keep on mining rather than investing their time and money in something else. Fees would be very small, but not zero.

## Why increasing the max block size is urgent

>If the number of transactions waiting gets large enough, the end result will be an over-saturated network, busy doing nothing productive. I don’t think that is likely– it is more likely people just stop using Bitcoin because transaction confirmation becomes increasingly unreliable.

>I can imagine a lot of possible futures, from big merchants and exchanges investing in mining to save themselves on transaction fees and ensure that their transactions are confirmed securely, to assurance contracts, to a cartel of miners regulated and funded and licensed as a global public utility.

>Did you mean "Peter Todd has convinced some big mining pool operators not to increase the size of the blocks they create" -- then great!

## For small payments

>If you think that the block size should stay at 1 megabyte forever, then you're saying the network will never support more than 7 transactions per second, and each transaction will need to be for a fairly large number of bitcoins (otherwise transaction fees will eat up the value of the transaction).

>If transactions are all pretty big, why the heck do we have 8 decimal places for the transaction amount?
>
>Don't get me wrong, I still think the bitcoin network is the wrong solution for sub-US-penny payments. But I see no reason why it can't continue to work well for small-amount (between a US $1 and $0.01) payments.

## A floating block size

>In my humble opinion, the block size should not be arbitrarily limited as it is now (1MB is the limit; typical blocks these days are 30-250K big), but should 'float' -- miners should collectively decide how large a block they're willing to validate and build on top of.
>
>Obviously a miner wants to include as many fee-paying transactions in their blocks as possible, until the fee paid is less than their cost of validating and including the transaction (which is a small cost).
>
>But miners also don't want to spend a very long time validating other miners' blocks, so they have an incentive to ignore blocks that are outrageously big. If they were willing to build on a 10-gigabyte-big block that took ten minutes to download and signature check, then they're shooting themselves in the foot-- an evil miner could mine a huge block, and then get a head start on mining the next block while the rest of the network was busy validating it.
>
>BUT: moving to a floating maximum block size determined by miners will be really hard; it will require everybody-- merchants and miners and users-- to upgrade. It may never happen, because other ways of supporting very high transaction volumes might develop before then.

>I expect the bitcoin network will look very different from the way it looks today, and I expect there will be several different solutions for how to scale up. If (when!) Bitcoin gets that successful, there will be serious money hiring the same smart people who figured out how to scale up PayPal and Visa.

## The incentives are what matter

>I'm really pleased to see very smart people thinking hard about the incentive structures built-in to Bitcoin. I think most people see all the digital signatures and peer-to-peer networking technology but miss that much of the brilliance of Bitcoin is how the incentives are designed.

## The future is SPV

>Honestly, I don't think the future of bitcoin is running "heavy" nodes on our personal computers. I think the vast majority of people will be using bitcoin through web or mobile apps in the not-too-distant future. So I'm not personally inclined to put a lot of effort into splitting the node and wallet, unless that makes creating lightweight web and mobile apps easier.

## Satoshi pre-mining

>I want to squash the "Satoshi mined a bunch of bitcoins on his own before releasing the bitcoin chain" idea.  He publicly announced bitcoin version 0.1 six days after he generated the genesis block: January 9, 2009.
>
>According to the block chain history, he generated about 10 blocks total before the announcement.  And we know that he didn't pre-generate blocks because the genesis block contains a quote from the January 3rd Financial Times newspaper.

## Illegal blockchain content

>Putting illegal content in the block chain and announcing it as an attempt to undermine Bitcoin seems like a good way to get yourself arrested.
>
>You'll have both law enforcement and techies trying to track you down, and given that people are already deploying de-anonymizing tools it seems pretty darn likely that you'd get caught.

## If Bitcoin is only used for crime...

>Bitcoin's technology is unstoppable, like p2p filesharing has proven to be unstoppable. But "the Bitcoin Project" could fail in a bunch of different ways.
>
>If mainstream people think "Oh, bitcoin is that internet thing used by criminals", that is bad for bitcoin. It might be bad enough to kill the project (note that I said "the project", not "the technology").
>
>If bitcoin really does turn into an internet thing only used by criminals then I'll personally consider it a failed experiment and will find something else to do.

## Why does Bitcoin have value?

>Ask yourself why anything has value.
>
>Tools, like hammers or cars or pants, have value mostly because they're useful and it takes effort to create them.
>
>Some things have value because they're beautiful or rare.
>
>Bitcoins have value because they are useful and rare.  As more and more people use them, they're useful for more and more things-- so their value will increase.  A lot of the current value of bitcoin is people who realize this and are trying to 'buy in early' -- they think that bitcoin will be used for more trading next year, so the value will be higher, so they want to get some now before the price rises.
>
>I have no idea what the "right" value for bitcoin is, but I am very encouraged by all of the fantastic, innovative ways people are using bitcoin.  I expect most of those experiments will fail, and I hope that everybody realizes that there will be lots of failures along the way to what I hope will be a huge success.

## Compatible with the existing system

>I think the goals of this project are to create a better currency, create a more competitive and efficient international payment system, and give people more direct control over their finances.  And I don't think any of those goals are incompatible with the goals of government.

## Commercial Bitcoin mining is cleaner than gold mining

>If more bitcoin adoption means bitcoin mining replaces actual, physical gold and silver mining then that should be a net positive for the environment.  Gold mining is dirty, dangerous, and destructive; if bitcoins eventually become "a better gold", then there will be less pressure to dig up virgin wilderness.
>
>Right now, bitcoin mining is inefficient, but natural economic forces will make it become increasingly efficient.  We've already seen that, with more efficient GPU mining replacing CPU mining because you get more hashing for less electricity.
>
>Eventually, I'm confident you'll see big commercial-scale bitcoin mining operations in places where either electricity is clean and cheap to produce, or where the waste heat from bitcoin production is put to productive use (maybe we'll all have network-connected bitcoin-mining space heaters to warm our offices in 10 years).
>
>Before then, we probably will see bitcoin production using cheap, dirty electricity in poorer countries.  If history is any guide, as that helps to make those countries richer their citizens will demand better environmental standards.  Even if we all decided that is unacceptable, I don't see any way to prevent it-- there's no way to tell if a bitcoin was generated using solar panels in the Sahara or dirty coal in Pennsylvania.

## Savings in Bitcoin and digital gold

>Saving for the future:  bitcoins are designed to be like gold: durable, only a limited supply.  They have some advantages over gold-- they're much easier to store safely (you don't have to buy a bank vault or hire guards or trust a storage company) and, because they're electronic, they can be backed up.  And when it is time to sell them the transaction costs are very, very low.
>
>Buy some goods online:  I don't think bitcoins have any significant advantage... yet.  Transaction fees are lower once you get bitcoins, but the transaction fees to get bitcoins probably eliminate that advantage.

## The advantage of Bitcoin

>I think Bitcoin's real, hidden advantage is the fact that you don't have to ask anybody's permission or fill out any paperwork to start doing creative, innovative things with them.  Lots of people are doing lots of innovative things with bitcoins, and while most of those innovative things will probably fail (most startups fail), I'm optimistic that some will succeed and in 5 years we'll be using bitcoins in some way we haven't even imagined yet.  I'm not going to pretend to know which market niches bitcoin will fill-- maybe it will be migrant workers using bitcoin to send money back home and avoiding international wire transfer and currency conversion fees.
>
>Maybe teenagers in China will use them to buy stuff online because they can't get a credit card.
>
>Maybe big multinational corporations will decide to use bitcoins to pay their supply chain to avoid currency exchange risk and save 0.1% on their transactions.  Who knows?  Even if bitcoin turns out to be just "a better store of value than gold" it will be hugely successful.

## Scalability concerns

>Making it easier for merchants to accept bitcoins, and users to pay using them, aught to be priority number 1.
>
>There's a great talk by the CTO of Facebook available on Youtube, and I think he gave the right advice on scaling:
Don't worry much about it until just before it becomes a problem.  Don't overengineer, because you're likely to waste time doing something that turns out to be irrelevant.
>
>I think Satoshi has done an amazingly fantastic job.

## Most people will run lightweight clients

>By the time Bitcoins replace the Euro I think most people will be running lightweight clients on wireless smartcards in their (physical) wallet that don't pay attention to every single transaction.
