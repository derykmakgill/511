Tomorrow I'll post the first introductory essay to Breaking Satoshi Season One. Season One is about what broke Bitcoin—the history, philosophy, economics, and psychology behind the takeover of the most important financial innovation in hundreds of years.

Essay series' on this site will be accompanied by a more frequent blog and email list about everything in Bitcoin I'm thinking on. Think of these as teasers, intermissions, or mini-episodes between lengthier essays and research.
