Tomorrow I'll post the first introductory essay to Breaking Satoshi Season One. Season One is about what broke Bitcoinâ€”the history, philosophy, economics, and psychology behind the takeover of the most important financial innovation in hundreds of years.

Essay series' on this site will be accompanied by a more frequent blog and email list about everything in Bitcoin I'm thinking on. Think of these as teasers, intermissions, or mini-episodes between lengthier essays and research.
