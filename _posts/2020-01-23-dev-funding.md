title: Thoughts on the BCH dev funding announcement

I've been trying to wrap my head around the Bitcoin Cash developer funding announcement and the various responses to it.

It's been difficult because I think it was not clear from the article exactly what certain things meant, but I have some thoughts on it now, in a list in no particular order of importance.

- **It looks like most of the details are still being decided.** I don't think this was quite clear from the post but I'm convinced now that, for what it's worth, there is still a lot the miners need to settle amongst themselves. If there are some details you are worried about, make a rational case for them instead of asserting demands which you are in no position to enforce.

- **"Why wasn't I consulted???" seems to be the general flavor of many of the posts in Telegram and Reddit.** Nobody needs to consult you though, and I think this communitarian mindset is one of the problems in Bitcoin Cash right now. Miners put up the capital investment to secure the network and validate transactions. They enforce the rules, not Twitter users or Reddit accounts, and you will never build a global financial system if all the major players in the space need to go to Reddit to ask the crowd permission before they take action. So I actually saw the announcement's *fait accompli* tone as a good sign, because its a step in the direction of miners asserting their exective role in Bitcoin Cash.

- **It's not a tax. It's not coercive.** I was surprised to see so many people blur the distinction between a tax and a service fee, which is effectively what this is. The miners in question, if they have majority hash, have decided that they will not spend time, energy or money to mine the blocks of miners who do not want to pay extra for it. That's their choice. There's nothing coercive about this. They are not obligated to do business with anyone or to mine their blocks if they can't agree to proper terms.

- **Miners choose.** This is how Bitcoin works, and I thought more people in Bitcoin Cash understood this.

- **I don't agree with the statement in the AMA that developers will set the agenda.** I had hoped the development agenda would be set by profit-seeking miners who give funds to developers for the specific projects miners have decided are worth investing in. I'm worried this could easily turn into a slush-fund boondoggle for developers, a sort of universal basic income for them that gives them more leeway to turn Bitcoin Cash into science project instead of the tight leash and collar with clear success metrics it should be. 

- **I don't agree with the statement in the AMA that most of the funds will be "general donations."** I don't think forking over a pot of money and then saying "figure out something useful to do" is a very smart way to get useful things done. The money should come with very clear goals and timelines.

- **I would rather see one of the major businesses or miners completely absorb ABC as their employees or start their own node implementation.**  This still feels a bit too non-profity for me, too churchy. That might change as new details are hashed out.

- **"[How will the Hong Kong coorporations be held accountable to the community](https://read.cash/@Jake/some-thoughts-questions-on-jiang-zhuoers-miner-funding-announcement-84549728)" is the wrong question.** It is not "community" money. It is miner money being made available for a very specific purpose. I'm not convinced they need to be transparent anymore than any normal business should be transparent.

- **The scheme for playing the hashrate dynamics between BTC and BCH seems clever at first glance.** I'm curious whether or not it will work in practice and whether or not there will be any unintended consequences, but I think it's an interesting play to try to increase the difficulty on BTC right around the time of the halving.

- **Everybody won't be happy. That's okay.** For months we've heard ad nauseum that if the big players in BCH don't fund developers, they are greedy bastards. When some of us proposed that miners start employing devs directly, people called it Blockstream 2.0. Now when a new plan is proposed, people call it an evil cartel. I wish miners would listen less to the mob and just seek profit.

- **It looks like a temporary proposal.** If it doesn't work, then it shouldn't be a problem to correct course. The sky is not falling. Relax. I will be the first to cry bloody murder though if a protocol change is made to perpetually fund developers.

These are interesting times! No, I don't quite agree with everything I read in that article or saw in the AMA, but I think the basic idea of miners asserting a more executive role in BCH is a good one. 

Let's see how it plays out in practice.
