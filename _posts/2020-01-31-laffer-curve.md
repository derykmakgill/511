The Laffer Curve is an illustration by Arthur Laffer which describes the negative effects of tax increases on total tax revenue.

It is based on the economic understanding that individuals will change their behavior when the incentives around them change. 

In the case of taxes, the Laffer Curve shows us that there exists some difficult to determine threshold beyond which people will simply reduce the amount of their taxed behavior, like work and investment, causing tax revenue to drop to lower levels than before the tax increase.

It's surprisingly simple, but it explains why so many central planning regimes fail. They don't consider incentives of their policies! They think they can raise taxes forever and people will continue acting exactly as they did before. 

But people don't do that.

## The Makgill Curve

We need a Laffer Curve for Bitcoin. Let's call it...The Makgill Curve.

The Makgill Curve states that increases to the cost of transaction fees on the Biticoin Network have a diminishing return on total fee revenue collected by miners because a threshold exists beyond which people won't use Bitcoin so much.

The Makgill Curve helps explain Bitcoin [BTC's artifical demand cap.](https://breakingsatoshi.com/2020/01/17/btc-price-cap/) It is an answer to the shallow jokes about ['pulling out the champaign'](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-December/015455.html) made by certain Bitcoin developers celebrating when Bitcoin fees rise due the Bitcoin blocks being full. 

They do not understand that fees can only rise so high before people or businesses drop off the network entirely, causing miners to collect less total revenue than they could have collected if fees were lower but more people used the network. 

## Putting it into practice

The Makgill Curve won't tell us the ['ideal' fee cost](https://breakingsatoshi.com/2020/01/19/ideal-block-size/) or the maximum miner revenue. It only tells us that there exists some point at which the highest possible fee revenue can be collected by miners, after which any fee increase will lead to reduced total revenue.

Obviously a 0% fee would mean that, after the subsidy, miners collect no revenue. Obviously a 100% fee would mean that nobody could use the network at all. Somewhere between that is the right number for both miners and users, but how do we figure that out?

We need unbounded block sizes to do that. Artificial limits make it difficult for miners and users to negotiate the optimal cost of fees on the network. They run the risk of driving fees higher than they should go for miners to maximize profits.

As I've written on Twitter recently, limits on block size are really limits on profit. The miner who wants to maximize profit needs to be able to set block sizes that allow them to process the optimal number of transactions at the optimal fee level, but they cannot do this when blocks are limited.
