title: Introduction (What is Breaking Bitcoin?)
---

On July 28th, 2010, BitcoinTalk user bytemaster made a post that questioned Bitcoin's ability to scale as a daily payments technology for the world.

>I am convinced that bandwidth, disk space, and computation time necessary to distribute and "finalize" a transaction will be prohibitively expensive for micro-payments.

His doubts weren't new or controversial at the time. As soon as Satoshi Nakamoto announced Bitcoin on the Cryptography Mailing List in 2008, influential list members were questioning his vision for how Bitcoin would work at scale. The argument was that the cost of running a Bitcoin node would grow too expensive for most people to run unless bandwidth costs were intentionally restricted, and certain use cases for Bitcoin, particularly micropayments and daily transactions, curtailed.

It was a debate that would come up over and over again before and after Satoshi's mysterious disapeerance—what should be prioritized in Bitcoin? Its use as cheap, fast, reliable digital cash? Or the egalitarian 'ideal' that all users must run their own Bitcoin software even at the expense of usefulness in commerce?—and Satoshi always replied the same way.

>The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

In Satoshi's view, Bitcoin could scale by professionalizing. Bitcoin in the future would be secured and operated like any other global system: by large companies with substantial capital in the game, not by small hobbyists. Most people could simply be users.

Obviously frustrated by what he saw as a repeat misunderstanding of Bitcoin, Satoshi ended the thread with bytemaster:

>If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.

Some people did believe him and did 'get it,' but most didn't, and when Satoshi disapeared several months later, the project passed into the control of developer Gavin Andresen and other early Bitcoin developers. Writing to developer Mike Hearn in April 2011, Satoshi vaguely explained his exit.

> I've moved on to other things.  It's in good hands with Gavin and everyone.

For several years, Bitcoin grew as planned. A mining industry exploded, users around the world began transacting with it in commerce, and businesses emerged to both faciiliate that commerce ane to sell goods and services in exchange for Bitcoin. As long as Satoshi's original scaling model was followed, Bitcoin worked as it was supposed to.

We'll cover this all more later in this essay series, as well as look deeper at what Satoshi saw for Bitcoin and its future, but for now, readers only need to know that beneath the obvious success of Bitcoin, the old debate was still there. While developers like Gavin and Mike understood and supported Satoshi's plans for Bitcoin, many did not. They either interpreted Satoshi's words in unconvential ways, stretching or often redefining entirely the meaning of words to fit their vision for Bitcoin, or denied the usefullness of Satoshi's thoughts on his creation entirely. Those people would later push Gavin, Mike, and others unceremoniously out of Bitcoin development for working towards this original vision.

The consequences for Bitcoin were catastrophic.
