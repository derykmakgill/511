title: How did we break Bitcoin?
---

On July 28th, 2010, BitcoinTalk user bytemaster questioned Bitcoin's ability to scale as a daily payments technology for the world.

>I am convinced that bandwidth, disk space, and computation time necessary to distribute and "finalize" a transaction will be prohibitively expensive for micro-payments.

His doubts weren't new or controversial. As soon as Satoshi Nakamoto announced Bitcoin on the Cryptography Mailing List in 2008, list members were questioning his vision for how Bitcoin would work at scale. The argument was that the cost of running a Bitcoin node would grow too expensive unless bandwidth costs were intentionally restricted, and certain use cases for Bitcoin, particularly micropayments and daily transactions, curtailed.

It was a debate that would come up over and over again before and after Satoshi's mysterious disapeerance. Satoshi replied.

>The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

In other words, Bitcoin can scale by professionalizing. Bitcoin in the future will be secured and operated like any other global system: by large companies with substantial capital in the game.

Obviously frustrated by this recurring question, Satoshi ended the thread:

>If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.
