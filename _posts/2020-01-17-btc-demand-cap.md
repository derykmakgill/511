title: BTC's artifical cap on demand and price

I rocked the boat a bit yesterday when I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/derykmakgill/status/1217636530342318083) that BTC likely has price ceiling because demand is kept artifically low by block size caps.

Paul wrote in reply:

Ron had this to say:

Paul and Ron both *wrong,* and they're wrong for basically the same reason. They're committing the fallacy of failing to discriminate crucial differences.

While it's obviously true that scarcity and demand can cause prices to increase for gold, oil and other commodities, this does not necessarily always hold true for the BTC chain of Bitcoin because BTC is fundamentally different than gold and oil.

The reason is acutally quite simple and since it was implicit in my original Tweet about this, I'm surprised so many missed it. 

Unlike gold and oil, which remain functionally unchanged when demand and price rise, BTC actually degrades when more people want it. In 2017, when there was a mad rush to purchase Bitcoin that took the price to $20,000 per coin, we saw mempool backlogs that lasted days and fees upwards of $50 and more. BTC broke down. It became less divisible. It became less portable. It became less useable. It became less and less like the Bitcoin that was marketed to the public and which helped create that demand in the first place.

Do you see the difference?

Oil doesn't behave like this. While the price for oil might rise when more people are buying it, the oil itself remains completely unchanged. It will work in my car exactly the same no matter the purchase price, no matter how many people want that oil. And despite all of the attempts to label Bitcoin as "digital gold," gold does not become more expensive to transact with or heavier to carry when demand rises. It remains entirely unchanged at scale.

I suspect the confusion here is partly that BTC used to function more similarly to gold int his regard, but it doesn't anymore by *design.* The economics have been broken for a long time. Core developers, either through economic incompetence or deliberate subversion, crippled the original protocol with artifical block-size limits. These limits effectively broke the Bitcoin network's utility any time it experiences an increase in demand. 

A protocol that gets functionally worse when more people try to participate in it will necessarily have a limit on its potential price for two reasons.

1. Once demand reaches a certain level, the *reasons for that demand* cease to exist. If oil stops working at a certain demand level, it will never cross that demand threshold.

2. The number of people who can practically act on the demand at any given time is slowed down or even halted as more people try to act on that demand.

Ironically, the argument that Paul and Ron make only applies to big-block Bitcoin, which, like gold, functions the same when one person wants it as when millions do. It's likely this version of Bitcoin only that has the kind of price potential so many people like to talk about.
