title: BTC's artifical cap on demand and price

I rocked the boat a bit yesterday when I tweeted out in response to a claim that BTC would soon reach $100,000 per Bitcoin
that BTC likely has price ceiling well below that because demand is kept artifically low by block size caps.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s unlikely BTC can reach 100k—demand is kept artificially restricted by block limits.

Paul wrote in reply:

Ron had this to say:

And 'J' said this:

Now, Paul, Ron and J are all *wrong,* and they're all wrong for basically the same reason. They're committing the fallacy of failing to discriminate crucial differences.

While it's obviously true that scarcity and demand can cause prices to increase for gold, oil, and many other products or commodoties, this does not necessarily always hold true for the BTC chain of Bitcoin because BTC is fundamentally different than gold, oil, or say, a new iPhone.

The reason is acutally quite simple and since it was implicit in my original Tweet about this, I'm surprised so many missed it. Unlike gold, oil, or a new iPhone, which remain functionally unchanged except in price when demand rises, BTC actually degrades when more people try to buy it. It gets provably worse when demand rises. In 2017, when there was a mad rush to purchase Bitcoin that took the price to $20,000 per coin, we saw mempool backlogs that lasted days and fees upwards of $50 and more. BTC broke down. It became less divisible. It came less portable. It became less useable. It became less and less like the Bitcoin that was marketed to the public and which helped create that demand in the first place.

Oil doesn't behave like this. While the price for oil might rise when more people are buying it, the oil itself remains completely unchanged. It will work in my car exactly the same no matter the purchase price, no matter how many people want that oil. While the price of an iPhone might rise after a new release and squatters buy them up to sell them on eBay, the iPhones themselves remain unchanged. And iPhone works the same whether I paid $1,000 or got one for free, whether a million people want it or ten people want it. And despite all the attempts to label Bitcoin "digital gold," gold does not become more expensive to transact with or heavier to carry when demand rises. It remains entirely unchanged at scale in all things except price.

BTC doesn't work like this anymore by *design* because the economics have been broken. Core developers, either through economic incompetence or deliberate subversion, crippled the original protocol with artifical block-size limits that effectively broke the Bitcoin network's utility any time it experiences a signifcant increase in demand. A protocol that stops working when more people try to participate in it will necessarily have a limit on its potential price because the reasons that demand exists disappear once a certain level of demand is reached, and because only a certain number of people are able to actually be on the network at any given time.

Ironically, the argument that Paul, Ron and J make only applies to big-block Bitcoin, which, like gold, functions the same when one person wants it as when millions do. It's likely this version of Bitcoin only that has the kind of price potential so many people like to talk about.
