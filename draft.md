title: Crypto-Austrianism and Digital Gold
---

I’ve been thinking a lot about how nobody knows anything about Austrian economics in Bitcoin and I think at least one of the reasons comes down to this.

People like to name drop Austrian economists. *Name drop.* Not read. That would require work and comes with no immediate social validation on Twitter or conference speaking gigs. It’s not that everyone is stupid, though there is plenty of that to go around, it’s that  they have realized they can get the social benefit of being seen as having economic insight while being totally ignorant of the actual facts. 

This became totally clear to me in September 2018 when I was on the famous cruise in Barcelona where Roger Ver was set up in a fixed debate by Jimmy Song. I realized listening to Jimmy that, while he loved to talk about Austrian economics, he had never actually read anything from that school of thought. Just like he was playing dress up as a cowboy, he was playing intellectual dress up as an economic thinker by dropping a few names and terms here and there.

Jimmy is no exception, he’s the norm, and Bitcoin is now crippled because of absolutely horrible economic thought masquerading as "Austrian" economics.

Breaking Satoshi is all about, among other things, exposing these economic fallacies that have led to the ‘breaking’ of Satoshi’s vision for Bitcoin, and one I’ve written about the last two days is the idea of Bitcoin as digital gold, which is just about the most pernicious economic myth in Bitcoin today.

Thought manipulators like Jimmy Song love to name drop thinkers like Rothbard and Mises and Hayek to justify a set of remarkably dumb opinions like Bitcoin is a ‘store of value,’ not a medium of exchange, just like gold.

One book in particular the people in BTC like to mention is a must read is Rothbards What Has Governnment Done with our money. It’s a book I haven’t read since 8th or 9th grade but it really informed a lot of my thinking on monetary questions, and over the years I’ve seen them keep mentioning this book and I’ve always thoohhht ‘I don’t remember that being his point.’

Well this evening I had a bit of gin and sat down to reread it and wow, was I amazed at how much they have bastardized rothbards incredible work.

I don’t know about you but in my ideal voluntarism society they would be jailed or at least publicly flogged for the economics blasphemies they’ve committed in rothnards name

And, no, we can’t count the gloriously drunken nonsequirter thay is the bitcoin standard by Seinfeld Ammous. 

I realized too that Song and his type are the quintessential charalatan, the types who cash in on the name  of their intellectual superiors to support causes entirely at odds with their work because they’ve never bothered to read or understand them.

“It is no crime to be ignorant of economics, which is, after all, a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a ‘dismal science.’ But it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance.”
