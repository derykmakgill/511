title: Crypto-Austrianism and Digital Gold
---

I’ve been thinking a lot about how nobody knows anything about Austrian economics in Bitcoin, and I think at least one of the reasons comes down to this.

People like to name drop Austrian economists. *Name drop.* Not read. That would require work and comes with no immediate social validation on Twitter or conference speaking gigs. It’s not that everyone is stupid, though there is plenty of that to go around, it’s that they have realized they can get the social benefit of being seen as having economic insight while being totally ignorant of the actual facts.

This became totally clear to me in September 2018 when I was on the famous cruise in Barcelona where Roger Ver was set up in a fixed debate by Jimmy Song. I realized listening to Jimmy that, while he loved to talk about Austrian economics, he had never actually read anything from that school of thought.[^1] Just like he was playing dress up as a cowboy, he was playing intellectual dress up as an economic thinker by dropping a few names and terms here and there.

Ironically, this particular form of charlatanry was given roundhouse condmenation by the great Austrian economist Murray Rothbard, who will talk about more in a moment.

> It is no crime to be ignorant of economics, which is, after all, a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a ‘dismal science.’ But it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance.

And Jimmy is no exception, he’s the norm. Thanks to people like him, Bitcoin is now crippled because of absolutely horrible economic thought masquerading as "Austrian" economics. [^2]

Breaking Satoshi is all about, among other things, exposing these economic fallacies that have led to the ‘breaking’ of Satoshi’s vision for Bitcoin, and one I’ve written about the last two days is the idea of Bitcoin as digital gold, a 'store of value' as opposed a medium of exchange, which is just about the most pernicious economic myth in Bitcoin today.

Thought manipulators in BTC love to name drop thinkers like Rothbard and Mises and Hayek to justify this point, and one book in particular they say is a must read is Rothbard's *What Has Governnment Done With Our Money?* 

The Nakamoto Institute, which is run by two of the most [redacted bit that is unfit for print], even hosts a [free copy](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/what-has-government-done-to-our-money.pdf) on their website, but you should click my Amazon affiliate link and buy a hard copy.

It’s a book I hadn't read since 8th or 9th grade but it really informed a lot of my thinking on monetary questions. Whenever I've seen this book mentioned in support of the 'digital gold as store of value' idea, I’ve always thought that I don’t remember taking away the same points from the book that the small-block Bitcoiners have.

Well, this evening I had a bit of gin and sat down to reread it and was I amazed at how much they have bastardized Rothbard's incredible work! I have to assume they have never read it, because it's not a minor point here or there that they've missed, it's the entire point.

Since I've seen this particular book arrogantly referenced in arguments on Twitter and Reddit about why Bitcoin can be a store of value even if it is unusable as a medium of exchange in commerce, or why big-block Bitcoin is a scammy con, you can imagine I nearly choked on my drink when I read the following bit from Rothbard.

> **Many textbooks say that money has several functions: a medium of exchange, unit of account, or “measure of values,” a “store of value,” etc. But it should be clear that all of these functions are simply corollaries of the one great function: the medium of exchange.** Because gold is a general medium, it is most marketable, it can be stored to serve as a medium in the future as well as the present, and all prices are expressed in its terms. Because gold is a commodity medium for all exchanges, it can serve as a unit of account for present, and expected future, prices. It is important to realize that money cannot be an abstract unit of account or claim, except insofar as it serves as a medium of exchange.

Rothbard actually argues the opposite of what they claim. If this is too dense for you, here is what he is essentially saying...

1. The one function of money is to be a medium of exchange. Anything else, such as 'store of value,' is a secondary function.
2. The reason gold functioned as an effective store of value for the future is because of the properties that make it a marketable medium of exchange now.

I don’t know about you but in my ideal contractual voluntarist society the people who argue that Bitcoin only needs to be a store of value might be contractually bound to be publicly flogged for the economics blasphemies they’ve committed in this book's name.

Let's look at a few more selections from Rothbard's book. Keep in mind that to Rothbard, gold was the ideal form of money, and this book argues for gold.

> [Money’s] function is to act as a medium of exchanges—to enable goods and services to travel more expeditiously from one person to another. 

Here he claims that the purpose of money is to facilitate exchange, and indeed, to make it easier to trade goods from one person to another. 

When you hear the shallow wisecracks from people in Bitcoin about how Bitcoin isn't designed for making daily purchases or how you should "just use Visa," this is really an accidental admission on their part that their version of Bitcoin, BTC, isn't actually good money, and an admission they must be lying about their reading credentials.

Here's another quote from the book.

> The money-commodity is divisible into small units, and it is generally acceptable by all.

In other words, if a form of money is not acceptable by all because it is, for example, too expensive to use for most daily transactions or to divide into smaller pieces, it's not good money. It's not as marketable as a money that is, as Rothbard writes in the same section, "more divisible into smaller units..." and "more transportable over large distances."

[^2] I realized too that Song and his type are the quintessential charalatan, the types who cash in on the name  of their intellectual superiors to support causes entirely at odds with their work because they’ve never bothered to read or understand them.
