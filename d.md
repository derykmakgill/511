title: Security risks of high Bitcoin fees
---

Henry *Hazlitt’s Economics in One Lesson* ought to be required reading for everyone making decisions in Bitcoin. There’s a particular quote I try to keep in my mind at all times when I think about Bitcoin.

> The bad economist sees only what immediately strikes the eye; the good economist also looks beyond. The bad economist sees only the direct consequences of a proposed course; the good economist looks also at the longer and indirect consequences. 

I think if more people thought like this about Bitcoin’s security model, we would never have allowed the block size debates to occur. The Blockstream cabal may still have tried to take over the network, but enough people would have been able to see through their arguments about the security necessity of keeping node costs low or driving fees high that they would not have had any real power to cripple they network for their own financial gain.

As it is, we lost the first round, but I think we can still win in the end if we ground everything we do in rational economics. As author Steve Patterson wrote recently, ‘economically superior cryptocurrencies will outcompete ideologically or technically superior ones.’

Let’s think about Bitcoin’s security model and the indirect consequences of high fees on the network, with these two caveats.

- I mean high fees in a very specific sense—not high fees as such, but centrally planned high fees by design, the kind that exist on BTC today about which we hear so many jokes like ‘use Visa’ and ‘Bitcoin is not for coffee.’ Fee markets are not bad, and we should never have granted that term to Core, who, contrary to creating a fee market, are price fixing through centrally planned production quotas on block space. That is not a market. 
- I am just going to assume people are correct when they say we need more people to run nodes, not because I agree, but because we can crush that argument anyway even under that false premise.

And remember, we’re looking at the long range consequences of a given policy, not just the immediate effects. We’ll see that the security model of BTC serves a purpose almost entirely contrary to the expressed intentions.
