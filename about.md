This is a project researching what when wrong in the BTC fork of Bitcoin, ie, what led to its 'fall.'

Think of the posts here less as a blog or a formal program, but more as unpolished open notes and thoughts, posted daily.  I'll answer questions like:

- What was Satoshi's real vision for Bitcoin?
- What did the cypherpunks really think about digital cash back in the day?
- What events, cultural climate, and arguments lead to Bitcoin being turned against its original purpose? Who is responsible? Why?
- What does a world built on the new vision for Bitcoin look like? 

I hope to produce a bing-worthy series of essays, interviews, and notes on the question: what happened to Bitcoin?
